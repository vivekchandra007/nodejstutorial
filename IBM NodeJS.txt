node js
=======
Anything which Javascript can, will eventually be done in javascript. But that does't mean we do everthing in javascript. That will be a really bad world.
It has its advantages, still a lot of untapped opportunites where javascript can perform exceptionally well, but a lot of places where it mustn't be.
What JS is extremely efficient at doing is "communication"
this low latency highly frequent communication
"middle-end"
